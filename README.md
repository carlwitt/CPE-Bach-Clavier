# About

This is a [Sphinx][Sphinx] adaptation of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach's "Versuch über die wahre Art das Clavier zu spielen" (An Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments). 

The book is considered a valuable source for the study of the piano, particularly old music repertoire.

It is structured in two parts. The first part covers
- Principles of fingering ("Vom Fingersatz")
- Different kinds of ornamentation ("Von den Manieren")
- How to perform a piece, musical expression ("Vom Vortrage")

The second part covers 
- Music theory, e.g., various types of chords
- Figured bass ("Generalbass")
- Random bits and pieces, e.g., more notes on how to improvise, more on ornamentation, how to deal with fermatas, etc.
Its form is a bit peculiar and has been critized for having a somewhat erratic structure and in general its aphoristic form rather than presenting a consistent set of aesthetic principles.

I created this adaptation to make the book more accessible to a modern and international audience. Except   is written in German and printed in old Fraktur typeface.

## Sources and Acknowledgments

The book was published in two parts, the first appeared in 1753 and the second in 1762.
Later editions of the book came out in the 1780s and 90s, and more followed in the 19th and 20th century.

Facsimile scans of several german editions are available as PDF from [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/Versuch_über_die_wahre_Art_das_Clavier_zu_spielen,_H.868,_870_(Bach,_Carl_Philipp_Emanuel)).

There's an english translation by William J. Mitchell which is available from [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/BACHCarlPhilippeEmanuel.EssayOnTheTrueArtOfPlayingKeyboardInstruments/page/n3/mode/2up). It provides scans of the translated book and a text version, but there are no hyperlinks in these versions and the character recognition has failed in several places, such that reading the text version is not very pleasant.

Jean-Pierre Coulon created the only good quality transcribed version of the book that I know of, including musical examples. That must have been a lot of work.
His version is available as a tex file also from [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/Versuch_über_die_wahre_Art_das_Clavier_zu_spielen,_H.868,_870_(Bach,_Carl_Philipp_Emanuel)).
