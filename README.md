# About

This is a digitized and translated version of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach's "Versuch über die wahre Art das Clavier zu spielen" – "An Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments". 

## Content

The book is considered a valuable source for the study of the piano, particularly old music repertoire. 

It is structured in two parts. The first part covers
- Principles of fingering ("Vom Fingersatz")
- Different kinds of ornamentation ("Von den Manieren")
- How to perform a piece, musical expression ("Vom Vortrage")

The second part covers 
- Music theory, e.g., various types of chords
- Figured bass ("Generalbass")
- Random bits and pieces, for instance
  - notes on how to improvise
  - more on ornamentation
  - how to deal with fermatas
  
The book's form is a bit peculiar and has been critized for its somewhat erratic structure and in general its aphoristic form. However, it is an entertaining (funny in parts) read and provides first hand information on the music and performance practice of the time – for instance it was not unusual for a pianist to play for four hours without a break.

## Motivation

I created this adaptation to make the book more accessible to a modern and international audience.

It is easier to navigate, since I did not find an edition with a hyperlinked table of contents and navigating a 500 page PDF can be tiresome. This version is available as PDF, epub and online book.

It's also easier to read, the 18th century language and the Fraktur typeface take quite some getting used to. The notation examples have been updated to today's standard Treble and Bass clefs, instead of the originally used Soprano and Bass clefs.

## Sources and Acknowledgments

The book was published in two parts, the first appeared in 1753 and the second in 1762.
Later editions of the book came out in the 1780s and 90s, and more followed in the 19th and 20th century.

Facsimile scans of several german editions are available as PDF from [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/Versuch_über_die_wahre_Art_das_Clavier_zu_spielen,_H.868,_870_(Bach,_Carl_Philipp_Emanuel)).

There's an english translation by William J. Mitchell available both as PDF and text from [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/BACHCarlPhilippeEmanuel.EssayOnTheTrueArtOfPlayingKeyboardInstruments/page/n3/mode/2up). It provides scans of the english book and a plain text version, but the text version has no links and the character recognition has introduced various errors.

Jean-Pierre Coulon created the only good quality transcribed version of the book that I know of, including musical examples, which must have been a lot of work.
His version is available as a tex file in french language from [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/Versuch_über_die_wahre_Art_das_Clavier_zu_spielen,_H.868,_870_(Bach,_Carl_Philipp_Emanuel)).

## Method

I used the first edition of the german facsimile scans as a basis for the german text. I used an LLM (Large Language Model) to correct the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) errors.

The english version is based on the translation by William J. Mitchell. Again, I also an LLM to correct the errors introduced by the character recognition.

In both versions, I added the musical examples transcribed from Jean-Pierre Coulon's version. The display is based on [VexFlow](https://www.vexflow.com/), a JavaScript library for rendering music notation in the browser.
